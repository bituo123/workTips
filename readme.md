## Here are my job tips where I will record some small tricks and work experiences. Currently, the main technologies I use are JavaScript, Vue, React, React Native, as well as some component libraries such as ElementUI and Ant Design, and some CSS tips.

## H5 Use background-image on input[type=range]::-webkit-slider-thumb for styling has whitespace problem

Scaling with transform can address the issue of background image causing whitespace on both sides of H5 input[type=range]::-webkit-slider-thumb. Avoid using margin-left and margin-right for input[type=range]::-webkit-slider-thumb as only margin-left is effective.
